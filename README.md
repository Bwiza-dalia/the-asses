# Vehicle Theft Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
Data-driven analysis of vehicle theft patterns across New Zealand to support evidence-based policing strategies. This project analyzes 4,553 theft incidents to identify hotspots, temporal patterns, and vehicle targeting preferences.

## Key Findings
- **Gisborne** identified as highest risk region requiring immediate attention
- **Monday** shows peak theft activity across all regions
- **Stationwagons** are most targeted vehicle type (20.8% of thefts)
- **40.1%** of thefts occur during weekends (Friday-Sunday)

## Technology Stack
- **Python** - Data analysis and processing
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive analysis environment
- **pandas, numpy** - Data manipulation
- **matplotlib, seaborn, plotly** - Data visualization
- **React + Vite** - Interactive dashboard
- **Tailwind CSS** - Dashboard styling
